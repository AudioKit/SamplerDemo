# AKSamplerDemo for Mac

## Getting the demo samples
To use this demo, you will first need to have some samples to load. Start by downloading [these ready-made samples](http://audiokit.io/downloads/ROMPlayerInstruments.zip). Unzip wherever you wish, and edit line 63 of *Conductor.swift* with the correct path to wherever you put the *ROMPlayer Instruments* folder. (For quickest results, unzip right in your *Downloads* folder. Then on line 63, you need only change the user name "shane" to your user name.)

The demo samples are the same as the ones included in the AudioKit **ROMPlayer** code repo on GitHub. They have been compressed using [WavPack](http://www.wavpack.com), and a `.sfz` metadata file has been added, to specify key/velocity mapping and loop points.
