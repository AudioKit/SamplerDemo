# AudioKit Sampler Demo for Mac

## Getting the demo samples
To use this demo, you will first need to have some samples to load. Start by downloading [these ready-made samples](http://audiokit.io/downloads/ROMPlayerInstruments.zip). Unzip wherever you wish, and edit line 63 of *Conductor.swift* with the correct path to wherever you put the *ROMPlayer Instruments* folder. (For quickest results, unzip right in your *Downloads* folder. Then on line 63, you need only change the user name "shane" to your user name.)
